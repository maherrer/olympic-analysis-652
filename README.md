## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- What are the top-performing countries in the Olympics?
- How does athlete count relate to medal performance?
- Which countries dominate which sports?
- Is there gender balance in Olympic sports?
- How have participation patterns changed over 124 years?
- Can we predict medal outcomes based on historical patterns?

## 🧠 Machine Learning Highlight

We built a **Decision Tree classifier** to predict whether a country will win:
- 🥇 Gold
- 🥈 Silver
- 🥉 Bronze
- ❌ No medals

**Model Accuracy: 87%**
